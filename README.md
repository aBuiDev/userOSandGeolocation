## **R7** | Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app:
####

Currently, there are no online platforms specifically developed for users to buy and sell second-hand gaming pc parts. PC components, especially gaming components, become obsolete quickly. For example, a little over a year ago, NVIDIA released their first RTX series graphic cards, however recently (October 2020), a new generation of RTX graphic cards have now been released - rendering the first generation of RTX cards obsolete/outdated. The first generation of RTX card leading the market for a year is actually a long time compared to other years. In some years, the release of new graphics cards could cause the latest generation of technology to be outdated after only six months. With the introduction of NVIDIA's ray tracing technology, all previous generation cards (the GTX series) are now considered obsolete due to the influx of new generation gaming that adopts ray-tracing.

<br>

This situation mainly affords to three unique cases:

1. Consumer one purchases a new generation card to replace their last-generation card as soon as the new generation card is out, leaving their old cards to permanent storage. This is similar to the iPhone mentality, where people would purchase a new generation of iPhone because they don't want to be using old tech. 
2. Consumer two purchases an identical graphic card to what they already own (at a lowered price due to being a later generation of card), to increase the performance of their system through NVIDIA SLI or AMD CrossFire. 
3. Consumer three who hasn't upgraded their graphic card in a long time decide to purchase a new generation card to replace their older generation card to achieve a standard of performance that matches what their requirements are, i.e. update specifications to cater for demanding computer games.

<br>

These situations create an opportunity for consumers to be able to resell their old video cards/gaming computer tech. For instance, instead of putting their video card to waste, consumer one can resell it to someone like consumer two who wants to purchase another identical graphics card and consumer one's could be it.

## **R8** | Why is it a problem that needs solving?:
####

The problem:

Currently, there are no second-hand computer part retailers besides actual retail stores like MWAVE who have a small section dedicated to refurbished goods (not second-hand goods). Larger companies like PC Case Gear (one of Australia's largest online computer retailers) don't even have a section dedicated to moving second-hand goods. PC Case Gear also only offer a minimal amount of refurbished goods.

Currently, the best place to buy second-hand parts is on Gumtree or eBay, but navigating through a plethora of computer parts is difficult - especially with no proper detailed filtration systems to find specific computer components. eBay's filtration system is sound; however, there are a limited amount of second-hand gaming goods being sold over eBay. Gumtree's simple interface doesn't allow sellers to output the full details required to 'sell' their items - which can deter buyers as it may be more difficult for them to find what they are specifically after, i.e. consumer two might have a much older generation card that was part of a minimal release, i.e. the GTX 970 turbo. These were unique cards with special cooling systems that were released at a limited quantity, finding one today on Gumtree or eBay for SLI purposes would be extremely difficult.

The solution:

Gaming Element aims to streamline the buying and selling of second-hand computer parts.
